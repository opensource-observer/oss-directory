description:
  Xone Chain is a modular Layer‑1 blockchain combining Ethereum-compatible
  EVM functionality with Cosmos SDK architecture. It powers a Behavior Value Incentive
  (BVI) model that rewards real-world on-chain behaviors using its native XOC token,
  aiming for fast finality (~1 s blocks), modular execution, privacy features (zk‑SNARKs,
  stealth addresses), and seamless cross-chain interoperability.
