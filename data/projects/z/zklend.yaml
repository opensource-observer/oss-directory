description:
  zkLend is a decentralized Layer-2 money-market protocol built on the
  StarkNet blockchain, enabling users to supply, borrow, and earn yield on digital
  assets in a permissionless DeFi environment. It leverages zk-rollup scalability
  and Ethereum security to offer fast, low-cost lending and borrowing services and
  supports liquidity markets for various tokens. As of early 2025, protocols operations
  were suspended due to a security exploit, and markets have been wound down with
  recovery processes ongoing.
