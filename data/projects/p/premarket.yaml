description: PreMarkets lets you trade early on what happens next—bet on market caps/FDV ranges for upcoming TGEs, pre-IPO valuation ranges, and simple yes/no outcomes, with transparent odds and settlement when results are known; it also supports commitment-style markets designed to bring real pre-launch liquidity and signal demand, and can extend to broader macro forecasts like commodity or land prices.
