description: Ponzi Land is an on-chain strategy game that lets players stake tokens, own land, and earn rewards through a game-style economic system tied to blockchain mechanics. Players stake tokens to maintain ownership, claim taxes from neighboring plots, and can level up or lose land if their stakes run out. The game incorporates elements of token staking and competitive resource management in a shared economy.
