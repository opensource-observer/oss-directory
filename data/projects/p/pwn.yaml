description: PWN is a universal, peer-to-peer lending and borrowing protocol that allows users to use any on-chain asset as collateral while maintaining full control over loan terms. All PWN loans are protected from price-based liquidations. The only way to lose collateral is to miss the loan repayment deadline.
