description: "Airswift’s Supply Chain Financing Platform unlocks new lending
  channels in supply chains via Stellar's new smart contract platform ---
  Soroban. The solution helps buyers optimize their working capital and provide
  SMEs with the funds they need prior to payment from the buyer, regardless of
  whether they have a direct relationship with the buyer.    The platform
  leverages credit from large buyers through tokenizing their account
  receivables on Stellar and fractionalizing them into smaller ones representing
  amounts owed to individual suppliers. Consequently, associated suppliers can
  obtain factoring services for a given account receivable, based on which they
  can secure advanced stablecoin loans equal to what will be owed them by the
  buyer. This process enables up to 10 suppliers associated with an account
  receivable to obtain credit lines so they can secure working capital. "
