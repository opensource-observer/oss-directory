  OnchainHeritage is a fully on-chain interactive Web3 experience that
  transforms every wallet interaction into a meaningful contribution to a collective
  legacy. Each time a user interacts with the smart contract, they unlock a small
  part of a large pixel-art image. Once the community reaches 100,000 total interactions,
  the complete artwork is revealed.
