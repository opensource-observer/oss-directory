description: OmniLumen is a comprehensive development environment for Stellar
  and Soroban, offering a suite of integrated tools and libraries to streamline
  the development process. OmniLumen offers a comprehensive local development
  suite for Stellar, similar to how wagmi.sh provides tools for Ethereum Virtual
  Machine (EVM) development. While wagmi.sh simplifies building on EVM with
  React hooks and CLI tools, OmniLumen delivers similar capabilities tailored
  for Stellar, including quick start, BigQuery integration, and local LLM
  integration.
