description:
  Otherside is a gamified, interoperable MMORPG-style metaverse under development
  by Yuga Labs in partnership with Improbable (via M²). Players hold NFT land parcels
  (“Otherdeeds”) that grant access to prototype builds, resource harvesting, and character
  interaction—often using NFTs as playable avatars. The platform emphasizes scaled, community-led worldbuilding through its ODK (Otherside Development Kit), and integration with ApeCoin as its native economy.
