description: "Beans is a non-custodial payments and savings app built on
  Stellar. Most blockchain based apps have targeted the crypto community. We
  have taken a different approach and will target the general public. Inside the
  app all blockchain-related things have been abstracted away, offering a bank
  experience using blockchain technology! We are aiming to be the first app to
  get significant traction on blockchain payments! "
