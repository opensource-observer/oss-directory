description:
  Stakeland is a community-driven social staking platform built by the
  Memeland team. Users stake MEME tokens (and potentially NFTs) to earn "Steaks" points,
  which are then burned to receive new project tokensâ€”often via quests and gamified
  tasks. It combines liquid ETH staking, governance via Runecoin, and community rewards
  for participation.
