description: Solaxy is a Layer‑2 rollup built for Solana, processing transactions off‑chain and settling them on the mainnet to reduce congestion, cut fees, and increase throughput. It also includes a bridge to Ethereum, staking mechanics with high APY, and a memecoin‑flavored community design driven by its SOLX token during a presale that raised over $58 million.
