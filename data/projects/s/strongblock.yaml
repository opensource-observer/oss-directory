description:
  StrongBlock offers a “Nodes-as-a-Service” (NaaS) platform that allows
  users to deploy and run blockchain nodes (Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Polkadot, etc.)
  without coding or hosting complexity. Users stake STRNGR tokens to activate a node
  and receive daily rewards known as “Node Universal Basic Income” (NUBI). It also
  supports a Bring‑Your‑Own‑Node (BYoN) mode for existing operators. The protocol
  systematically burns tokens per node to maintain a deflationary supply and plans
  a decentralized governance rollout.
