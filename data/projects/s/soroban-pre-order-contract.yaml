description: Develops a novel Soroban contract that helps to fairly manage
  "first come, first served" sales processes. SPOC aims to provide a fair
  solution for both buyers and sellers. It asks the buyer to commit to their
  order of a product or service by providing an up-front payment for it. This
  gives the seller a specified amount of time to produce or procure the
  pre-ordered product. The Soroban contract itself serves as an escrow for
  payments and ensures that all specified terms are followed by both the buyer
  and the seller. The payment is either unlocked for the seller upon successful
  delivery, or is refundable to (and by) the buyer when the order expires, and
  also if the seller needs to cancel orders because their fulfillment isn't
  possible anymore.
