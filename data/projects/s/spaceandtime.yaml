description:
  Space and Time is a decentralized data warehouse and Layer‑1 blockchain
  built around Proof of SQL—a sub-second ZK coprocessor enabling smart contracts and
  AI agents to query on-chain and off‑chain data with cryptographic guarantees. It
  provides SQL interfaces, indexed real-time blockchain data from major networks,
  natural-language dashboards, and REST API publishing, making complex data logic
  both trustless and scalable.
