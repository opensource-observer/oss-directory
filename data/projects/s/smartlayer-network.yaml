description: Smart Layer Network is a programmable, blockchain‑based service network and integration layer designed to enable advanced token logic and seamless interactions across Web3 and Web2 environments. It supports “Smart Tokens” that carry executable logic to integrate diverse digital services, aiming to foster a tokenized web with enhanced integration, privacy, and trust. The ecosystem is governed via a decentralized model where service nodes provide APIs and are incentivized by the native SLN token.
