description: Soroban Explorer will allow all users on Stellar to validate the
  underlying code behind smart contracts on the protocol, increasing
  transparency, trust, and ultimately adoption of the Stellar network.  To
  enable this reality, our team will build the underlying functionality to
  compile source code and the interface that allows users to interact with the
  explorer.  Our proposal would address a critical need, verifying the
  underlying code behind smart contracts in the Stellar ecosystem, for users
  across Stellar.  The envisioned solution would be user-centric, with a clear
  output to users with a streamlined user interface that is designed to enhance
  existing user journeys across the Stellar ecosystem.
