  Self is a privacy-first, open-source identity protocol that uses zero-knowledge
  proofs for secure identity verification.  It enables Sybil resistance and selective
  disclosure using real-world attestations like passports. With a few lines of code,
  developers can easily check if their users are humans, while preserving their privacy.
