description: Stellarcarbon provides transparent nature-based carbon offsetting
  with proof of retirement on Stellar and in the Verra Registry. With
  Stellarcarbon, anyone with a Stellar account can do a voluntary carbon offset
  that is registered both on-chain and off-chain. We have been building the
  infrastructure needed to connect legacy carbon markets with the new digital
  economy taking place on public ledgers. Other companies building on Stellar
  will be able to integrate our backend service into their products and
  services, to give users easy access to carbon offsets. On top of this
  infrastructure, Stellarcarbon itself wants to develop and launch a retail shop
  for carbon offsetting aimed at individuals and businesses.
