  Scout Game is an onchain gamified talent referral platform that transforms
  open-source developer discovery into a fantasy sports-style experience.
  Players, known as Scouts, collect NFTs of developers and earn rewards as
  their selected builders contribute to approved open-source projects.
  This model incentivizes meaningful contributions and fosters a vibrant
  community supporting the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.
