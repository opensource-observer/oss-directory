description: Spark is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allocates capital across lending, savings, and liquidity markets to deliver scalable yield on stablecoins and other digital assets. It offers savings products, a decentralized lending market, cross‑chain liquidity deployment, and on‑chain governance via its native token. Spark aims to optimize capital efficiency by dynamically routing user deposits into high‑yield opportunities across DeFi, CeFi, and real‑world assets.
