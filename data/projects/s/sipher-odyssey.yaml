  Sipher Odyssey is a multiplayer looter-shooter action‑RPG set in Sipheria,
  where players build teams using unique races (INU, NEKO, BURU), battle procedurally
  generated dungeons, craft gear, and earn in‑game rewards redeemable both on-chain
  and off‑chain in a shared universe. Its $SIPHER token powers gameplay mechanics,
  staking, and in-game economy participation via bridges and marketplaces.
