description: SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides
  developers with fast, flexible, universal, and decentralised APIs for web3
  projects. We empower developers from over 100+ ecosystems including Stellar,
  Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot, Cosmos, Algorand, NEAR, and Avalanche with rich
  indexed data to allow them to build intuitive and immersive decentralised
  applications. This blockchain developer toolkit enables developers to focus on
  their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom
  backend for data processing activities. In the near future, the SubQuery
  Network will replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely
  decentralised manner.
