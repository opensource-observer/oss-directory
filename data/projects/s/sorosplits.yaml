description: SoroSplits is a set of smart contracts & interfaces to enable split
  transactions and revenue sharing across multiple parties in the Stellar
  ecosystem.  The core functionality of the smart contract will allow any assets
  (tokens) that exist on Stellar to be split in a trustless, automated, &
  transparent way across addresses and the user interface would enable all
  Stellar community members & projects to leverage the technology as a public
  good.  This functionality is a fundamental component to move the ecosystem
  away from off-chain counterparties and “trusted” middlemen to a truly
  decentralized contracting & payment structure.
