description: Loopring is a Layer 2 blockchain protocol built on Ethereum that enables fast, low‑cost, and secure trading, payments, and decentralized applications by using zero‑knowledge rollups. It supports non‑custodial decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and infrastructure where users retain control of their assets. The native LRC token is used for network utility, staking, and governance within the ecosystem.
