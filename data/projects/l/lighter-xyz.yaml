  Lighter is a decentralized perpetual futures trading protocol—built as
  an application-specific zk‑rollup on Ethereum/L2—that offers verifiable price-time-correct
  order matching and liquidation, low-latency execution (<5ms), and support for complex
  orders and public liquidity pools. Its cryptographic proofs ensure fairness, transparency,
  and no wash trading by design.
