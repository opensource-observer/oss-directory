  Lightchain AI is a Layer‑1 blockchain that integrates artificial intelligence
  into its core. It features a Proof‑of‑Intelligence (PoI) consensus—where nodes earn
  token rewards by performing AI tasks—and an AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) for on‑chain
  model execution. Governance is community‑driven, auditable, and evolving with developer
  contributions via grants and open SDKs
