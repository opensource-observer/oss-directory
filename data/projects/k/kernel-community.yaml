description: Kernel is an open, peer‑to‑peer community and cohort‑based learning environment where tech builders, creatives, and researchers collaborate on novel projects and deepen their understanding of the web’s future. It runs in multi‑week “blocks” that blend learning modules, conversations, and project work. The community bridges diverse thinkers and practitioners to cultivate new ideas through persistent engagement rather than formal coursework.
