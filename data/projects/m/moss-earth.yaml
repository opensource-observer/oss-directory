description: Moss Earth is a São Paulo–based climate‑tech firm that uses blockchain to tokenize verified carbon credits (MCO2), enabling transparent, traceable purchases that fund Amazon rainforest preservation. Its tokens empower both individuals and corporations to offset emissions with proof of impact—each MCO2 burns for one ton of CO₂ avoided—and proceeds have helped shield millions of hectares and hundreds of millions of trees.
