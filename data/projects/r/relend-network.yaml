description: Relend Network generates a unique stablecoin for each L1/ L2. rUSDC is backed by lending market collateral and is redeemable for 1:1 for USDC on Ethereum. Relend deploys rUSDC directly into money markets on partner chains, providing local and global price stability modules for redemptions. This model provides a seamless way for users to interact with stable assets across different chains with confidence in backing and liquidity.
