description: Friend.tech was a decentralized social network launched in August 2023 on Coinbase's Base blockchain. It allowed users to buy and sell "keys" linked to Twitter (now X) accounts, granting access to private chatrooms and exclusive content. The platform experienced rapid growth, generating significant fees and attracting a large user base. However, by September 2024, Friend.tech announced its shutdown, transferring protocol ownership to a null address, effectively ceasing operations.
