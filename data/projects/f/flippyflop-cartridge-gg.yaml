description:
  The Flippy Flop campaign on Starknet was a high-performance, user-friendly
  stress test in October 2024, not a traditional token airdrop. It featured a game
  where users competed against bots, showcasing features like Paymasters (no gas),
  Passkeys (no seed phrase), and Session Keys (no signatures) to reach a peak of 857
  TPS.
