description: Fren Pet is an incremental idle game on the Base blockchain where players adopt, feed, and train virtual pets, engaging in battles and exploring the Fren Pet world. Developed by @caduveloso and @surfcoderepeat, the game emphasizes true ownership, with pets represented as NFTs that can be bought, sold, or burned if not properly cared for. Players can participate in daily activities, mini-games, and quests to earn rewards, climb leaderboards, and customize their pets with various cosmetics.
